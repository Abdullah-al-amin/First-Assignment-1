            </div>
            <p>One good thing can be said about 2021: it wasn’t as tumultuous as 2020, which put in a claim to be the
                worst year ever. That, however, may be damning with faint praise. Yes, the past twelve months did bring
                some good news. Indeed, for a moment in early summer it seemed that COVID-19 was in the rearview mirror.

            </div>
            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without
                special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. The virus can
                spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak,
                sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do
                not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
                Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as
                acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
                Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have
                trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
                Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
